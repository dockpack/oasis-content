Agile: iterative and incremental 
- Each story is expanded, coded and tested 
- Possible release after each iteration

Testing as a Phase 
?? Code, then test 
?? Separate, siloed teams 
?? Heavyweight process 
?? Requirements, design documents 
?? Test plans 
?? “Traceability” 
?? Change review boards 
?? Testing “bottleneck” at end

Automation - After Coding 
?? Vendor tools 
?? Record/Playback 
?? Done by testers or automation team 
?? If developers automate unit tests – it’s after 
coding 
?? Expensive

Exploratory Testing – “agile”  
?? Exploring reveals unintended consequences 
and uncovers implicit expectations

testing/Careful observation 
?? Critical thinking, no requirements doc needed 
?? Diverse ideas 
?? Rich resources 
?? Tools, data, people

How Agile Changes Things 
?? Whole Team Approach 
?? Coding and testing are one process 
?? Feedback, collaboration key 
?? TDD/ATDD practices 
?? Test-infected developers, better tools, better-
designed tests

Test Approach - The Agile Way 
Project Initiation Get an understanding of  the project 
Participate in estimating stories  Create Test Plan  Release Planning 
Each Iteration 
             1  
           …. 
            X 
Write and execute story tests 
Write and execute new functional test cases 
Pair test with other testers, developers 
Automate new functional test cases 
Run automated regression test cases 
Perform Load Test 
Complete Regression Test 
Perform UAT 
Perform Mock Deploy 
Participate in Release Readiness 
System Test / 
End Game 
Participate in Release to Prod 
Participate in Retrospectives 
Release to Prod/ 
Support

The Whole Team Approach 
?? Team commitment to quality 
?? Team responsible for testing 
?? Testers get support, training 
?? Developers do testing activities 
?? Testers and developers pair 
?? Get the right people

Testing is Not a Phase 
?? Development = testing + coding 
?? Write test, write code, test 
?? At unit and acceptance test levels 
?? Automated tests 
?? Designed for efficiency, 
maintainability 
?? Free time for exploratory testing 
?? Team plans testing activities 
?? All four “quadrants”

Feedback Guides Development 
?? Team uses feedback to improve 
?? Testers are expert feedback providers 
?? Feedback lets team make course 
corrections
